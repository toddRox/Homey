# Homey
This is a sort of playground for me to learn Clojure and React, while still building something useful. Homey is a web application/API to provide general usefulness in my home. In a home with kids, it would be nice to control the wifi remotely or give the kids access to the family photos without the ability to do any damage. And these are exactly the kinds of things Homey will allow one to do.

The only intended user of Homey is me. Use any of this code at your own risk, without any assumptions.
